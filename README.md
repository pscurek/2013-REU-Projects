# 2013-REU-Projects

This repository houses the paper resulting from my research with Trevor Shumaker and Daniel Hirsbrunner at the University of Washington REU in mathematics.

During the REU, I also contributed to SageMath software. The documentation for those modeules can be found <a href="https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/logic/index.html">here</a>.
